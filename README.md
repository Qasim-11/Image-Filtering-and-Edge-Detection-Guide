## Image Filtering & Edge Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explains and demonstrates basic image filtering and edge detection techniques using Python and NumPy.

### ðŸ“– What's Inside

* Explanation and examples of the mean filter
* Explanation and examples of the median filter
* Gaussian filter basics and smoothing
* Simple edge detection with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal filters
* Combined visual outputs and comparisons
